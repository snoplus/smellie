The Monitoring PMT Units (MPU) must be kept completely light-tight in order to give reliable results.
For each of the scenarios detailed below, note the RMS of the PMT-Out signal as measured by an oscilloscope connected via a short-length BNC cable to the PMT-Out socket.
The scenarios should be performed in the order given, and obviously with the MPU's lid screwed tightly on.

--------------------------------------------------


1) No external lights, MPU power OFF, no fibre connected to the MPU
	- whatever value this gives is due to the scope itself - digital scopes will produce their own internal noise.  This reading can therefore be taken as the "zero" baseline.

2) No external lights, MPU Power ON, no fibre connected to the MPU
	- any change from the value in step 1) above must be due to noise in the (now powered) electronics themselves.
	- the electronic noise level at the time of assembling the MPU was found to be around 5 microvolts.

3) External lights ON, MPU Power ON, no fibre connected to the MPU
	- any change from the value in step 2) above indicates that there is indeed a light-leak somewhere.
	- check for gaps between components, or ill-fitting gaskets or aluminium plates in the fibre-coupler.  Also check that the MPU lid is tightly screwed on.

4) No external lights, MPU Power ON, fibre IS connected to the MPU
	- this should be exactly the same as the value in step 2) above.
	- if there is any change from the value in step 2), try covering the entire fibre to shield it from external light.

5) External lights ON, MPU Power ON, fibre IS connected to the MPU
	- any change from the value in step 3) above indicates that the fibre is not connecting correctly into the fibre coupler.
	- check that the fibre is indeed secure and not moving around in the coupler assembly.

--------------------------------------------------


If the MPU is completely light-tight, all 5 steps above will produce identical values of the signal RMS.
